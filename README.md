# Hi, I’m @wg481
- I’m interested in learning more about C/C# to create a Turn Based RPG in Unity3D.
- I’m learning C#, RMMV, and how to better my 3DS. I'm not as active in the first one, but I'm getting there.
- I have a potential collaboration project to start, but it's not ready to be put on Github just yet.
- To reach me, message me on Discord (wg481#2600) or find some way to at me. 

## What do you do?
Typically I'm on here to find 3DS homebrew, but I'm getting ready to start some projects in Github repo's.

## What coding experience do you have?
Very little GApps Script, amateur text-based Python, pretty good Scratch, absolutely garbage C#, and great RPG Maker MV (RMMV).

## Can you do something for me?
I do not commission anything, and I probably won't. (I think that's against the Github ToS). I can precompile stuff (if that's allowed.)

## Personal Task List
- [x] Set up Github account
- [x] Post something in a repo
- [x] Finish Github readme.md
- [ ] Post project repo
- [ ] Commmit to project repo
- [ ] Find more things to list
