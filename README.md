# Hi, I’m @wg481
- I’m interested in learning more about C/C# to create a Turn Based RPG in Unity3D.
- I’m learning C#, RMMV, and how to better my 3DS. I'm not as active in the first one, but I'm getting there.
- I have a potential collaboration project to start, but it's not ready to be put on Github just yet.
- To reach me, message me on Discord (wg481#2600) or find some way to at me. 

## What do you do?
Typically I'm on here to find 3DS homebrew, but I'm getting ready to start some projects in Github repo's.

## What coding experience do you have?
Very little GApps Script, amateur text-based Python, pretty good Scratch, absolutely garbage C#, and great RPG Maker MV (RMMV).

## What are you working on?
Right now I have a project that is almost ready to be put on Github. It'll be completely open-source and ready for use by anyone.
